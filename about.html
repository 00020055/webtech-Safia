            <p>"Development of an inclusive corporate culture based on the principles of equality, respect and support"
                From January to June 2024, the project employed more than 50 employees with disabilities on the production lines of the Safia factory. Each of them was assigned a mentor and provided with a sign language interpreter, which contributed to successful adaptation and improved communication.</p>
            <p>"Teaching high school students the basics of confectionery art - School of Confectionery"
                The first course of the "School of Confectionery" project was a course for students of school No. 339 in the Yashnabad district of Tashkent. Today, the School of Confectionery operates in the Yangiyul, Bukinsky and Piskent districts of the Tashkent region, as well as in the Children's Home No. 22 named after Khlebushkina and in the Mirabad district on the basis of school No. 154. In addition, dual education is currently being organized at the Zangiata Agrotechnological College of the Tashkent State Agrarian University together with the Safia confectionery factory. The main advantage of the course is that participants receive not only theoretical knowledge, but also undergo practical training at the confectionery factory.
